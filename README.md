**Abstract:**
This study uses Mass Mobilization (MM), Varieties of Democracy (V-Dem), and Human Development Index (HDI) data to predict the success of citizen protests against the state. 25 total logistic regression models were developed. Findings include the significance of interactions between democracy indices and protester demands, democracy indices and region, and which protester demand categories are associated with an increased likelihood of success. Furthermore, among protests with either protester or state violence, higher HDI scores are associated with a greatly increased likelihood of success. Limitations of this model include limited data size and uneven distribution of categorical variables. The model performances indicate that studies of political unrest and outbreaks of violence should take protester demands into consideration, as well as regional interactions with democracy indices.
